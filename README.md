# OA-LICalib: Observability-Aware Intrinsic and Extrinsic Calibration of LiDAR-IMU Systems

**OA-LICalib** is a versatile and highly repeatable calibration method for the LiDAR-inertial system within a continuous-time batch-optimization framework, where the intrinsics of both sensors and the spatial-temporal extrinsics between sensors are calibrated comprehensively without explicit hand-crafted targets. To improve efficiency and cope with challenges from degenerate motions, we introduce two dedicated modules to enable observability-aware calibration. Firstly, a data selection policy based on the information-theoretic metric selects informative segments for calibration in unconscious data collection process. Secondly, an observability-aware state update mechanism in the back-end optimization is introduced to update only the identifiable directions of the calibrated parameters by leveraging truncated singular value decomposition. In this way, the proposed method can get accurate calibration results even under degenerate cases where informative enough data segments do not exist. Extensive evaluations by both simulated and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and repeatability of the proposed method in common human-made scenarios and various robot platforms.

```

## Intrinsic and Extrinsic Calibration

![](./data/lidar_intrinsic.png)

The intrinsics of an individual laser comprising a multi-beam 3D LiDAR.

A example to calibrate extrinsics between LiDAR and IMU while simultaneously calibrating intrinsics of both LiDAR and IMU in simulation. You can find simulated data at [`./data/bag/simu_bag.bag`]. 
The ground truth of intrinsics are at `[./data/bag]` and of extrinsics are as follows:

```yaml
P_LinI [0.30, 0.15, 0.05] meter
euler_LtoI [1.0, 2.0, 5.0] degree
```
Check the  parameter `path_bag` in the `config/simu.yaml`, **change it to your absolute path**. Then run it!

```shell
roslaunch oa_licalib li_calib.launch
```

## Data Collection

OA-LICalib works with rosbag files which contains `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` and `sensor_msgs/Imu` topics. Also you can collect `nav_msgs/NavSatFix` or `nav_msgs/Odometry` to visualize your calibration results on Rviz.

The calibration accuracy is affected by the data collection environment. You should collect your data in a place that contains a lot of flat surfaces, and indoor spaces are the best locations under these conditions. However, you can also achieve good results outdoors. When collecting data, make sure to draw figures of eights and grids, capturing data from every angle

## Parameter Tuning

To achieve the best calibration results, you should tune the parameters in the `config/simu.yaml` file. The parameters are as follows:

| Parameter                           | Value                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ndtResolution | Resolution of NDT grid structure (VoxelGridCovariance)<br/>0,5 for indoor case and 1.0 for outdoor case | 
| ndt_key_frame_downsample    | Resolutation parameter for voxel grid downsample function |
| map_downsample_size       | Resolutation parameter for voxel grid downsample function |
| knot_distance            | time interval |
| plane_motion       | set true if you collect data from vehicle |
| gyro_weight       | gyrometer sensor output’s weight for trajectory estimation |
| accel_weight       | accelerometer sensor output’s weight for trajectory estimation |
| lidar_weight       | lidar sensor output’s weight for trajectory estimation |
